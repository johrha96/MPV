Initially reading and displaying the data, then the data was processed by converting all data into numbers and the features were visualized. In addition, I represented the rate of students who passed and those who failed, as shown below :

The goal of knowing the average of passable and failing students is to minimize student failure as much as possible.
The mother’s work was also clarified through the dataset so that I could see whether the students’ state was affected or not.

The graph shows that when the mother is educated, the student's performance is high and vice versa
